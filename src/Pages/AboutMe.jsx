      <h2>About Me</h2>
    
      <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Brad Harcourt, a dedicated and motivated professional making an exciting transition into web development. With a background in Health Information Management (HIM) recruiting, Iâ€™ve always enjoyed problem-solving and working with technology. However, I wanted to take my passion for tech even furtherâ€”so I decided to dive into web development.

Currently, Iâ€™m enrolled in a web development bootcamp, where Iâ€™m learning JavaScript, React, Node.js, and modern front-end and back-end technologies. Through hands-on projects, Iâ€™ve developed skills in building dynamic applications, responsive design, and problem-solving with code.
<br></br><br></br>
One of my favorite aspects of coding is the ability to turn ideas into fully functional applicationsâ€”itâ€™s both challenging and rewarding. 
As I continue to grow as a developer, Iâ€™m eager to work on real-world projects, collaborate with other developers, and refine my skills in full-stack development.

My goal is to leverage my analytical mindset, problem-solving skills, and technical knowledge to transition into a career as a web developer. Iâ€™m excited about the journey ahead and always looking for opportunities to learn, build, and connect with other developers.

Letâ€™s create something amazing together! ðŸš€</p>
